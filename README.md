## Description

This site is an updated collection of my notable projects that I have either created or collaborated on. It contains a new aesthetic and new features compared to my last portfolio.

## Usage

The navbar contains three different sections: 'About Me, 'Projects', and 'Contact Me'. The projects section is a drop down menu that contains the names of the projects featured on the site. When the names of the projects are clicked, it will redirect the user to either the deployed site or the repository of the application. If projects is clicked, it will scroll to the project cards section. When the other sections of the navbar are clicked, it will scroll to the corresponding section of the site.

## Technologies

* daisy UI
* HTML
* Hero component
* Project cards with image preview

## Features

The project cards with the image feature are a notable feature for this portfolio and it allows the user to see the set of projects in an organized manner all at once.
